### Live Demo

* [Map Overlays Available via TMS]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-plus/cookbook/read-hgt-files/latest/ )


## Concept

* The short term goal is to be able to:
	* Open and read using JavaScript the binary HGT files from Jonathan de Ferranti's [Viewfinder Panoramas]( http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html )
	* Display the data as bitmaps in HTML canvas elements
* The longer term goal is to use this ability to translate all of Ferranti's data into heightmaps that can be used to create 3D cartography
